# Report 5 - Week of 09/28/2023 #

In this Tuesday, we formed a group and ideated on what we could do with the Particle set. I was assigned to the agriculture group and we came up with a lot of great ideas, such as a food preservation system or a system helped plants for the natural disasters. 
I really liked this creative process! And looking forward for what we can do in future classes.
