This week, I wrapped up my project 4 and showed it in the final showcase
# Customized Resume Tailor

## Problem Discovery & Previous Solution 
I'm a Master of Design student at UC Berkeley as well as a UX Designer, building digital experiences and interfaces that are usable, enjoyable, and accessible. But, I’m not only a UX Designer. I’m also an Experience Designer, UI/UX Designer, Product Designer, and Interaction Designer. This variety stems from the fact that different companies often label the same role with different titles.  Consequently, I find myself adapting my job title to align with each company's unique terminology.

But here's a challenge: imagine competing with over a thousand other students for the same position. HR departments, inundated with resumes, rely heavily on the ATS (Applicant Tracking System). This AI tool is designed to scan resumes, identifying key terms that match the job description and filtering out those that don't.

To ensure my resume reaches a human reviewer, it must be ATS-optimized. For instance, if a job description emphasizes 'wireframing' and my resume mentions 'wireframes,' this slight discrepancy can impact my ATS score.

I meticulously align my resume's keywords with each job description, a process that takes about 20 minutes per resume, summing up to 8 hours a week. Below are a screenshot of all resumes I have parsed to accommodate for different companies. 

##  Potential New Solution
What if I could use artificial intelligence to outsmart this system? Imagine leveraging AI to tailor my resume efficiently, ensuring it resonates perfectly with each job's requirements. This approach could not only save precious time but also increase my chances of success in the competitive job market.

## Technology Exploration
Initially, I considered using GPTs to create a tool where I could upload my resume in PDF format, input a job description, and utilize a keyword bank for optimization. However, the challenge lies in comparing changes line by line and updating them in my Word document, particularly in pinpointing the exact modifications.

## Final Project

I aim to create a tool that first scans my resume to identify terms and skills with interchangeable words, categorizing them accordingly. Similarly, it will scan job descriptions, pinpoint terms and skills with alternatives, and categorize them. The final step is to replace the terms in my resume with the corresponding words from the job description.

### Part1: Parsing Resume
For the resume part, I'll feed it to AI for processing by converting it into a web page using HTML and CSS. Key skills in the resume will be enclosed in <span> tags with unique class names for each skill category, allowing the AI to highlight changes post-processing.

### Part2:Building Database
For the interchangeable database, I  built the interchangeable database in zerowith with JSON and asked it to output JSON as well. This allows for easy parsing of the data. Additionally, I increased the temperature setting to 2 to achieve more precise results.

### Part3: Parsing Job Description
For processing the job description, the user will first input it into the AI through the webpage. This webpage needs to be connected with ZeroWidth, which will then process the information and return it in JSON format. Subsequently, I'll parse this data for further use.

## Product Demo
Simply input the job description into the top right box, and the system will display detected keywords in the lower box. It will also highlight suggested changes on the left side for easy review and modification.

## Next Step:
### Short-term Goals:
- Enable AI-powered conversion of resumes into HTML/CSS format, identical to the original Word documents.
- Expand the keyword database specifically for UX designers.
### Long-term Goals:
- Integrate functionality for suggesting edits directly in Word/Google Docs, with easy 'accept changes' feature.
- Broaden the word banks to include a variety of professional roles, not limited to UX design.

## Speculation

- Impact on Human Experience: This project will streamline the resume tailoring process, significantly reducing the time job hunters spend on customizing applications, thereby enhancing their overall experience.
- Impact on Engineering: Widespread use of this tool could prompt recruiters to adopt more advanced methods for candidate selection, potentially driving further advancements in AI technology.

## Conclusion
This project marks a significant step in AI-assisted personalization, revolutionizing how we interact with technology in professional settings.
