# Report 2 - Week of 09/01/2023 #
This week, I dive deeper into TJ's grasshopper file. and I came up with a bunch of question. I asked Clara and she helped me a lot.
The two pictures below are some question I have while playing around with TJ's file.

Clara also sent me a file explaining all functions of Grasshopper. This helped a lot.

Later on, I brainstormed potential topics about Project 1 with CC together.
Below are some ideas we came up with.
