# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 #

In last Thursday's class, we formed a big group (6 people) to brainstorm what we can do with clean tech. Christine and Aylish came up with a very interesting story, like a giant spider climbing up and down to swipe up a spider net. However, I don't think these ideas are feasible. 

After Thursday's meeting, we saw Shm's message in Slack and divide up to 2 groups

I had another brainstormed session with Danny and Weilong and Sunday for around 1 hour and we decided to a Air Vest for free divers. We spent the rest of week to work on the deck. You can find the deck in this link.
