# Report 8 - Week of 10/19/2023 #

This week, our team dedicated significant effort to the development of our second assignment, titled "Puffer Fish."

### Last Thursday
We focused on testing the pulse indicators, familiarizing ourselves with its output range in relation to our heart rates. We established a criterion: if the heart rate exceeds the average by 20 units, we will consider the diver to be in danger.

### Monday
I collaborated with Carian and Danny to brainstorm the creation of our final video demos. We started drafting a script and outlining the user flow. Weilong and I also dedicated time to connect two photons. Initially, we attempted to link two devices under a single account, which involved disconnecting the Particle Account, unlinking the IoT, and then connecting the device to another computer and the Berkeley IoT account. Ultimately, we found it simpler to have two separate accounts communicate directly.

### Tuesday
Weilong successfully connected the two photons and integrated both the vibration feature and a button into the Photon loop.

### Wednesday 
Weilong was on the verge of connecting the servo to the photon. With assistance from Ankur, Cody, and Adoery, we addressed a connection issue. Adoery advised against connecting the servo to D0 and recommended D1 instead. After switching to D1, the servo vibrated but did not rotate. Adjusting the rotation speed from 1500 to 3000 resolved this, and the servo began to function correctly. Debugging was challenging as it was difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of issues, requiring iterative testing and adjustments.

Subsequently, with all tasks completed, Carina, Danny, and I proceeded to film the video. While Carina and Danny undertook the video editing, I focused on compiling a more detailed documentation report.
