### Wrapping up Project 1
Reflecting on Project 1:

On the previous Tuesday, I had the opportunity to receive valuable strategic feedback from my classmates. This feedback played a pivotal role in refining my design, culminating in the creation of the final PDF submission material. I'm pleased to report that I successfully submitted the project, marking the completion of Project 1. It was a significant learning experience, and I'm excited about what lies ahead.

### Transitioning to Project 2:

With Project 1 behind me, I eagerly transitioned into Project 2. During Monday's class, Jeff, Sudu, and TJ introduced the new project, and I wasted no time diving into the initial steps.
My first task was to familiarize myself with the particle set, and I diligently completed the first five steps of the tutorial to gain a solid foundation.
Overcoming Technical Challenges:

However, early on in Project 2, I encountered a technical issue. The system seemed unable to recognize the machine I was working with. Initially, I suspected that this might have been due to my omission of connecting the Photon2 with the required antenna, as indicated in the tutorial.

Seeking a solution, I reached out for assistance on our class's Slack channel. Sudu promptly responded and suggested that the issue might be related to my adapter. Following Sudu's advice, I decided to remove the adapter and connect the Photon 2 directly using a Type-C cable. This change resolved the problem, and I was able to continue with my work.
I would like to express my appreciation to Yanru, who helped me locate the necessary cable, facilitating a smooth resolution to this technical hiccup.
These experiences mark the beginning of Project 2, which promises to be another exciting learning journey.
