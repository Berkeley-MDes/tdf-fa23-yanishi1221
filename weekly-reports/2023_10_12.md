First of all, we purchased the air vest online, which is relatively expensive, and costs around $90. 
When we got the vest, we found it was pretty hard to pull the red handle

The motor supported by the Arduino/Photon might not have enough power to support it.

In addition, we also tried to connect the sensor that measures heart rate with Arduino. We might some difficulties there, and we are still in the progress of fixing it.

Overall, working.....
