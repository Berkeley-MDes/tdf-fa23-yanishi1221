# Report 13 - Week of 11/23/2023 #

## Reflecting on Last Week's Exploration
I contemplated various methods for implementing AI feedback. Initially, I considered building an API as a Google plugin or enabling direct changes in the offline Word document. However, after evaluating my resources, team size, and time constraints, I realized these approaches might not be feasible for my current situation.

## Insights from Collaboration
In my discussions with Shm, a new direction was suggested. She proposed building the resume in an HTML/CSS format, assigning unique IDs to sections with interchangeable words. These sections could then be dynamically updated using JavaScript. This approach seemed more manageable given my current capacity.

## Progress This Week
I began constructing the resume in HTML/CSS. This involved:

- Designing the layout and style of the resume.
- Assigning unique IDs to specific sections for future AI integration.
- Preparing the groundwork for JavaScript implementation.

This new direction promises a more practical and manageable way to integrate AI feedback into my resume. The upcoming steps will involve further development in JavaScript to actualize the AI recommendations.
