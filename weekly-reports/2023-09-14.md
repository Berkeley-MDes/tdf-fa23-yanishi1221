# Report 3 - Week of 09/14/2023 #
This week, I went on building the files 
1. The grasshopper demon TJ showed on the last Thursday, as well as the video are very helpful.
2. play with the grasshopper
3. first tweak: reduce the radius of the outside cone
4. change the cone shape on the outside to a cylinder. It's pretty easy to change the shape from the cone to the cylinder. Just change the components from cone to cylinder and conenct all the wires

**Replacing Cylinder with Cube: A More Complex Step:**

- The transition from a cylinder to a cube proved to be a more intricate task. It required the use of two domain sets to construct a rectangular shape, which was then converted into a boundary and extruded. One range set controlled the stand's width (X-direction), a relatively uncomplicated aspect. The other set, determining depth (Y-direction), presented a challenge.
- To optimize the design, I adjusted the Y-direction origin. Previously aligned with the 'pin phone location on the table,' this adjustment ensured equal spacing from both sides in the Y-direction. Given the need for sufficient depth on the front to securely hold the phone(With out enough depth, it will look like Version 2), I increased the depth value (Version 1). However, this change was balanced to prevent the creation of an excessively thick back wall. By moving the Y-origin forward by 5 units relative to the 'pin phone location on the table' in the Y-direction, I achieved the desired outcomeâ€”ample front depth while minimizing the rear volume (Version 3).
