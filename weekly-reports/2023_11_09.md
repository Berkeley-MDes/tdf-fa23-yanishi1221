# Reports of Week 11 - 2023/11/09

## Inspiration
This week, I worked on my proposal. I was inspired by the idea I shelved in project 3, a Resume Tailor to optimize resumes for specific job applications, focusing primarily on the domain of UX design. It utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze both the user's resume and the job description, providing tailored suggestions for resume enhancement.

## Weekly Plan
### Step 1: Configure Application Tracking System (Week1)
- Figure out how does application system filters resumes 
### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis  (Week2)
- Gather a dataset of UX design job descriptions and resumes.
- Analyze common keywords, skills, and qualifications.
### Step 3: User Interface Prototype (Week3)
- Design a simple and intuitive user interface for inputting resumes and job descriptions.
- Implement feedback mechanisms to understand user preferences and improve suggestions.
### Step 4: Testing and Iteration (Week4)
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the toolâ€™s effectiveness and usability.
- Iterate on the tool based on user feedback and test results.


## Current Work
### Job Scan
A paid AI-powered resume checker optimizes your resume for any job, highlighting the key experience and skills recruiters need to see.

## Motivation
As the tech industry has faced significant layoffs since 2023, the competition for junior-level user experience designer roles has intensified remarkably. It's not uncommon for a single position to attract over a thousand applications within a week. This surge has led many companies to adopt Application Tracking Systems (ATS) to manage the influx of resumes. In this competitive landscape, applicants must tailor their resumes to each job description meticulously. I spend about 10 minutes per application, carefully reading the job details, identifying key requirements, and customizing my resume accordingly. The process can become quite time-consuming considering the time it takes to apply for 10 roles daily. However, this task can be significantly expedited with the aid of a Customized Resume Tailor.
