## Classroom Experience:
Due to visibility issues in the classroom, I had to rely on post-class recordings to catch up with the content. The text displayed during lectures was too small for me to discern from the back of the room.

## Project Development:
### Initial Idea:
My initial idea was to create a dynamic resume drafter. The concept was to:

### Integrate my resume content.
- Use variables for keywords.
- Input different job descriptions to generate tailored resumes.
- This idea received preliminary approval from Jeff. However, it was later declined by the teaching team.

### Pivot to TDF-focused Mini-Me:
Given the feedback, I pivoted my project to focus solely on the TDF class. For this, I:

Fed a brief personal introduction, covering my educational and professional background.
Provided a concise description of the MDes program and its relation to the TDF class.
Gave an overview of the TDF class.
I was meticulous in crafting the sentences to ensure optimal token usage.

### Knowledge Database Integration:
I enriched the knowledge database with content from my Project 1 and Project 2 reports. Special emphasis was placed on the challenges faced during these projects. This database was then linked to the chat for querying.
